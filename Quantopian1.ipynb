    "Welcome to Quantopian! The Getting Started Tutorial serves as an introduction to writing and backtesting an algorithm on Quantopian. This tutorial covers many of the basics of the Quantopian API, and is designed for those who are new to Quantopian. This tutorial is divided into a series of lessons, with each one focusing on a different part of the API. By the end, we will work up to a simple mean reversion algorithm. The video series also covers the same material.\n",
    "What is a Trading Algorithm?\n",
    "On Quantopian, a trading algorithm is a Python program that defines two special functions: initialize() and handle_data(). initialize() is called when the program is started, and handle_data() is called once per minute during simulation or live-trading in events that we'll refer to as 'bars'. The job of initialize() is to perform any one-time startup logic. The job of handle_data() is to decide what orders, if any, should be placed each minute.\n",

    "An algorithm on Quantopian has 3 core functions: *initialize()*, *handle_data()*, and *before_trading_start()*. The first one, initialize(), must be implemented in every algorithm while handle_data() and before_trading_start() are optional. These functions each have a different role:\n",

To keep things simple, we'll start by manually referencing hand-picked securities. There are two ways to manually select securities on Quantopian: the *sid() function*, and the *symbol() function*.\n",
    "sid()\n",
    "The sid() function returns a security given a unique integer security ID (SID). sid() is a robust way to reference a security. The SID of a security remains constant despite ticker changes and as such, is a reliable way to reference a stock. A security's SID never changes.\n",
